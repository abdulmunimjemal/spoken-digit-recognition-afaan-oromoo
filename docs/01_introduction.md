# 1. Introduction & Problem Statement

## 🌍 The Context
Spoken Digit Recognition (SDR) is the "Hello World" of Speech Processing. While datasets like MNIST (for images) and LibriSpeech (for English audio) are ubiquitous, resources for African languages like **Afaan Oromoo** are significantly scarcer.

**Afaan Oromoo** is one of the most widely spoken languages in Africa, yet it remains under-represented in the digital AI landscape.

## 🎯 The Mission
This project aims to bridge that gap by building **SagalNet**, a **robust, open-source Spoken Digit Recognition system** specifically for Afaan Oromoo. Be achieving high accuracy (90%+), we prove that modern Deep Learning techniques can be effectively applied to low-resource languages with relatively small datasets.

## 💡 Use Cases
Why do we need this?

1.  **Accessibility**: Voice-controlled interfaces for the visually impaired or elderly who primarily speak Afaan Oromoo.
2.  **Education**: Interactive tools for children learning numbers and basic numeracy.
3.  **IVR Systems**: Automated phone menus ("Press 1 for English..." -> "Lakkoofsa 1 tuqi...").
4.  **Hands-Free Control**: Simple command interfaces for mobile apps.

## 🚀 Project Goals
*   **Accuracy**: Achieve >90% validation accuracy.
*   **Speed**: Real-time inference on standard CPUs (for mobile deployment).
*   **Usability**: An easy-to-use Interface (Streamlit) for non-technical users.
*   **Reproducibility**: A clean, modular codebase that others can learn from and extend.
